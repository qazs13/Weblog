            <h2>A) Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                It was so challenging to put the piles in such a clayey soil facing the sea. They chose the bored piles construction method due to the diameter of the pile and its depth. During the normal sequence of bored piles, they begin by excavating and pouring bentonite (High viscosity drilling fluid that support the sides of the excavation). But due to the mentioned soil conditions, the soil sometimes caves in before they could put the reinforcement and pour the concrete. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So, for this challenging soil, they came up with the idea of pouring mortar inside of the excavated hole for the pile that caves in and let it harder for three days, then they re-excavate through the mortar which makes it better than the natural soil and doesn't cave in. After that they proceed normally putting the casing for the first few meters and then pouring the Concrete. This method made them dig bigger holes at the beginning so they can re-dig through the mortar with the pile diameter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There were about 1,496 Piles distributed around the Towers and Podium.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Excavation was executed by Drilling Bored Pile Method, using IHI Bored Excavator.

                            When drilling through Clayey soil or very soft clay below the water table, special bentonite or polymer slurries are used to stabilize the borehole walls. Thanks to the greater specific weight of bentonite slurry compared to water and its capacity to create a waterproof layer over the borehole walls, these slurries, when applied for more than at least meter above the water table, help make the shaft watertight, preventing the walls from collapsing.

                            Temporary casing is used to retain the sides of the borehole only long enough for the fluid concrete to be placed. The temporary casing remains in place until the concrete has been poured to a level sufficient to withstand ground and groundwater pressures. The casing is removed after the concrete is placed.

                            A large casing driving plate is fitted under the rotary to couple the first 1.5 m-casing section. The soil therein is removed by means of boring tools such as drilling buckets. During the concreting stage casings are withdrawn in segments, extracted by the piling rig and or oscillator.

                        <h3>
                            The steel reinforcement cage is inserted in the shaft using a mobile crane of a suitable capacity. As it is being lowered, concrete or plastic spacers are applied to the outside of the cage to ensure the designed concrete cover.

                        <h3>
                            In order to guarantee sufficient concrete cover at the bottom of the pile, the cage is supported and suspended 15-20 cm from the bottom of the hole.

                        <h3>
                            To do this, a string of steel pipes with an internal diameter of no less than 250 mm is lowered down the center of the shaft. As a general rule, the string is made up of 2 or 3-meter-long sections which are connected to each other until they reach the bottom of the hole. A funnel is placed at the top of the string and the concrete is poured into it.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                            The concrete flows down the pipes and, when it reaches the bottom, it begins to fill the hole, rising back up. Thanks to the considerable difference in density between the two fluids, the slurry does not mix with the concrete 
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                            but is forced up towards the surface where it is collected in special slurry pits, ready to be used again. As the concrete rises inside the borehole, the string is shortened to ensure that no more than 3-4 m of piping is immerged in the wet concrete at any one time. 
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                            Once the concrete has reached the pre-established level, the pouring stops and the string are removed completely.
