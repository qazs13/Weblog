                <p>
                    The HSE plan has been developed through the four phases of Engineering, Administration, Performance Monitoring and Improvement. The four phase HSE plan forms a continual loop following administration so that the system is continually improved by lessons learned, new techniques and any revisions to the scope of work. HSE planning inputs are analyzed by process owners and the HSE Manager to prepare safety and environmental improvement methods for incorporation into operational procedures. The four phases are as follows:

                            Engineering phase is the Phase where Work place activities and their associated hazards are identified, assessed and classified. Priorities and objectives are assigned and an HSE plan is prepared. The inputs of HSE planning include information from workers, accident and incident records, local regulations, scope of work, existing building best practices, material specifications and recommendations for using materials and machines safely. These inputs are analyzed by process owners and the HSE Manager prepares HSE improvement methods for incorporation into operational procedures and method statements. HSE planning outputs include risk classification registers, HSE plans, safety checklists, permit to work procedures and job method statements.
