            <h2>A) Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                Self-consolidating concrete is a highly flowable type of concrete that spreads into the form without the need for mechanical vibration. Self-compacting concrete is a non-segregating concrete that is placed by means of its own weight. The importance of self-compacting concrete is that maintains all concreteâ€™s durability and characteristics, meeting expected performance requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Self-compacting concrete (SCC) can be defined as fresh concrete that flows under its own weight and does not require external vibration to undergo compaction. It is used in the construction where it is hard to use vibrators for consolidation of concrete. Filling and passing ability, segregation resistance are the properties of self-compacting concrete.
            </p>
            <p>
                In certain instances, the addition of superplasticizers and viscosity modifier are added to the mix, reducing bleeding and segregation. Concrete that segregates loses strength and results in honeycombed areas next to the formwork. A well-designed SCC mix does not segregate, has high deformability and excellent stability characteristics.

            <h2>B) Self-Compacting Concrete Properties:</h2>
            <p>
                Self-compacting concrete produces resistance to segregation by using mineral fillers or fines and using special admixtures. Self-consolidating concrete is required to flow and fill special forms under its own weight, it shall be flowable enough to pass through highly reinforced areas, and must be able to avoid aggregate segregation. This type of concrete must meet special project requirements in terms of placement and flow.
