            <p>
                The North Coast region is witnessing an unprecedented development with the emergence of the new city of El Alamein, 
                the newest fourth-generation city, which will serve as Egypt's gateway to Africa.
                The North Edge project or El-Alamein Towers is one of the largest projects currently being implemented in the North Coast area within the new El-Alamein City which is being implemented by the government with the aim of creating a residential,
                industrial, touristic and integrated city in the North Coast.

            <p>
                Arab Contractors’ scope is all the work packages included in the project. They are responsible for constructing three towers with a total area about 40,000 m2. Each tower consists of a basement, ground floor, and 38 typical floors with surface area approximately equal 1,450 m2. These towers are connected with a 4 floors commercial podium which will serve as a mall for the city residents, the podium starts with the first floor of the towers. The whole project is executed using reinforced concrete whose total volume reached almost 100,000 m3 while the weight of reinforcing steel bars is 20,000 tons.
            For the MEP package, there are five systems which will be installed in the project. These systems are:
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullets">
                        HVAC 
                        <h3>
                            According to the design, Chillers and Air Handling Unit (AHU) are located in the second floor of the podium which is assigned to contain the main components of all MEP systems. On the other hand, the Cooling Towers are located on the roof of the podium to be subjected directly to fresh air. These main components are assisted with similar ones in the machine rooms located on the 17th floor of each tower to deliver the air to upper stories. The estimated budget of HVAC is 850,000,000 LE.
                        </h3>

                        Firefighting System 
                        <h3>
                            In the second floor of the podium, there is a main pump station which consists of one electric drive pump, one diesel drive pump and one jockey pump. Also, there are similar pumps but with lower capacity located in the machine room in the 17th floor. Moreover, there are other firefighting systems in the towers such as FM 200 system and CO2 firefighting system. The total estimated budget of these systems is 150,000,000 LE.

                        <h3>
                            The power system is divided to main power system which feeds the towers and the podium with medium and low voltages. And the backup system in case of emergencies which consists of 3 large generators capable of feeding the towers and a UPS system which works for 15 minutes in the period between power cut and the start of generators. The approximate budget of these systems is 450,000,000 LE.

                            This system describes the ones which need low current such as CCTV, intercom, IP TV, public address and access control systems. The estimated budget is 250,000,000 LE.

                        <h3>
                            It is divided into firstly a sewage system consisting of submersible pump set and HDPE pipes network. Secondly a potable water system to provide water for the three towers and the podium.
                            The approximate budget of the garbage and plumbing systems combined is 120,000,000 LE which makes the total estimated budget for MEP works is 1,940,000,000 LE.

                <p>We initially intend to work on the Civil, MEP and Architectural work packages of one of the towers and the podium. This scope will allow us to work on several work packages in our graduation project from excavation of such huge area to concrete works to the aforementioned MEP systems and finally through the finishing of the tower.</p>
